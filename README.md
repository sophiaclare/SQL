### [CFG Final Project - University System Database Manipulation](https://github.com/sophiaclare/SQL/blob/main/CFG%20SQL%20Presentation.pdf) 

**Description:** Developed a simple relational database for a university system to manage students, professors, departments, courses, and course registrations. The project included creating tables, setting primary and foreign key constraints, creating a view, a stored function, a stored procedure, and a trigger, as well as writing and executing example SQL queries.

**Skills:** Database design, SQL scripting, Relational database management, Data manipulation and analysis, MySQL Workbench

**Technology:** MySQL Workbench, MySQL

**Results:** The successful implementation of the university system database has resulted in a streamlined data management process. The database provides an efficient way to store and manage information on students, professors, departments, and courses. The creation of a view simplifies course registration data retrieval, while a stored function calculates the number of students in a specific course. Additionally, a stored procedure manages course enrollment, and a trigger automatically updates student department information. Example SQL queries demonstrate the ability to extract and analyze data from the database for various use cases.
